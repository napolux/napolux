## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Napo

Staff Software Engineer focused on frontend architecture, performance, and developer experience. I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Go, and GraphQL and I care deeply about code quality, async collaboration, and building things that scale.

Iâ€™ve contributed to production systems in remote-first teams, mentored engineers, shaped technical direction, and helped improve how teams build and ship software.

I also speak at international conferences like [WeAreDevelopers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/), [Codemotion](https://events.codemotion.com/), and [Open Source Day](https://www.osday.dev/) about frontend engineering, remote work, and developer experience. I've also created [fullremote.it](https://fullremote.it).
